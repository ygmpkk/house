-- Catching exceptions

-- |This is the simplest of the exception-catching functions.  It
-- takes a single argument, runs it, and if an exception is raised
-- the \"handler\" is executed, with the value of the exception passed as an
-- argument.  Otherwise, the result is returned as normal.  For example:
--
-- >   catch (openFile f ReadMode) 
-- >       (\e -> hPutStr stderr (\"Couldn\'t open \"++f++\": \" ++ show e))
--
-- For catching exceptions in pure (non-'IO') expressions, see the
-- function 'evaluate'.
--
-- Note that due to Haskell\'s unspecified evaluation order, an
-- expression may return one of several possible exceptions: consider
-- the expression @error \"urk\" + 1 \`div\` 0@.  Does
-- 'catch' execute the handler passing
-- @ErrorCall \"urk\"@, or @ArithError DivideByZero@?
--
-- The answer is \"either\": 'catch' makes a
-- non-deterministic choice about which exception to catch.  If you
-- call it again, you might get a different exception back.  This is
-- ok, because 'catch' is an 'IO' computation.
--
-- Note that 'catch' catches all types of exceptions, and is generally
-- used for \"cleaning up\" before passing on the exception using
-- 'throwIO'.  It is not good practice to discard the exception and
-- continue, without first checking the type of the exception (it
-- might be a 'ThreadKilled', for example).  In this case it is usually better
-- to use 'catchJust' and select the kinds of exceptions to catch.
--
-- Also note that The "Prelude" also exports a
-- function called 'catch' which has the same type as
-- 'Control.Exception.catch', the difference being that the
-- "Prelude" version only catches the IO and user
-- families of exceptions (as required by Haskell 98).  We recommend
-- either hiding the "Prelude" version of
-- 'catch' when importing
-- "Control.Exception", or importing
-- "Control.Exception" qualified, to avoid name-clashes.

catch  	:: IO a 		-- ^ The computation to run
  	-> (Exception -> IO a)	-- ^ Handler to invoke if an exception is raised
  	-> IO a			
catch =  ExceptionBase.catchException

-- | The function 'catchJust' is like 'catch', but it takes an extra
-- argument which is an /exception predicate/, a function which
-- selects which type of exceptions we\'re interested in.  There are
-- some predefined exception predicates for useful subsets of
-- exceptions: 'ioErrors', 'arithExceptions', and so on.  For example,
-- to catch just calls to the 'error' function, we could use
--
-- >   result <- catchJust errorCalls thing_to_try handler
--
-- Any other exceptions which are not matched by the predicate
-- are re-raised, and may be caught by an enclosing
-- 'catch' or 'catchJust'.
catchJust
	:: (Exception -> Maybe b) -- ^ Predicate to select exceptions
	-> IO a		 	  -- ^ Computation to run
	-> (b -> IO a)		  -- ^ Handler
	-> IO a
catchJust p a handler = catch a handler'
  where handler' e = case p e of 
			Nothing -> throw e
			Just b  -> handler b

-- | A version of 'catch' with the arguments swapped around; useful in
-- situations where the code for the handler is shorter.  For example:
--
-- >   do handle (\e -> exitWith (ExitFailure 1)) $
-- >	  ...
handle	   :: (Exception -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handle     =  flip catch

-- | A version of 'catchJust' with the arguments swapped around (see
-- 'handle').
handleJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a -> IO a
handleJust p =  flip (catchJust p)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- evaluate

-- | Forces its argument to be evaluated, and returns the result in
-- the 'IO' monad.  It can be used to order evaluation with respect to
-- other 'IO' operations; its semantics are given by
--
-- >   evaluate undefined `seq` return ()  ==> return ()
-- >   catch (evaluate undefined) (\e -> return ())  ==> return ()
--
-- NOTE: @(evaluate a)@ is /not/ the same as @(a \`seq\` return a)@.
#ifdef __GLASGOW_HASKELL__
evaluate :: a -> IO a
evaluate a = IO $ \s -> case a `seq` () of () -> (# s, a #)
	-- NB. can't write  
	-- 	a `seq` (# s, a #)
	-- because we can't have an unboxed tuple as a function argument
#endif

-- 'mapException'

-- | This function maps one exception into another as proposed in the
-- paper \"A semantics for imprecise exceptions\".

-- Notice that the usage of 'unsafePerformIO' is safe here.

mapException f v = unsafePerformIO (catch (evaluate v)
                                          (\x -> throw (f x)))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 'try' and variations.

-- | Similar to 'catch', but returns an 'Either' result which is
-- @(Right a)@ if no exception was raised, or @(Left e)@ if an
-- exception was raised and its value is @e@.
--
-- >  try a = catch (Right \`liftM\` a) (return . Left)
--
-- Note: as with 'catch', it is only polite to use this variant if you intend
-- to re-throw the exception after performing whatever cleanup is needed.
-- Otherwise, 'tryJust' is generally considered to be better.
--
try :: IO a -> IO (Either Exception a)
try a = catch (a >>= \ v -> return (Right v)) (\e -> return (Left e))

-- | A variant of 'try' that takes an exception predicate to select
-- which exceptions are caught (c.f. 'catchJust').  If the exception
-- does not match the predicate, it is re-thrown.
tryJust :: (Exception -> Maybe b) -> IO a -> IO (Either b a)
tryJust p a = do

#endif /* __GLASGOW_HASKELL__ */

-- | Catch dynamic exceptions of the required type.  All other
-- exceptions are re-thrown, including dynamic exceptions of the wrong
-- type.
--
-- When using dynamic exceptions it is advisable to define a new
-- datatype to use for your exception type, to avoid possible clashes
-- with dynamic exceptions used in other libraries.

-- Some Useful Functions

-- | When you want to acquire a resource, do some work with it, and
-- then release the resource, it is a good idea to use 'bracket',
-- because 'bracket' will install the necessary exception handler to
-- release the resource in the event that an exception is raised
-- during the computation.  If an exception is raised, then 'bracket' will 
-- re-raise the exception (after performing the release).
--
-- A common example is opening a file:
--
-- > bracket
-- >   (openFile "filename" ReadMode)
-- >   (hClose)
-- >   (\handle -> do { ... })
--
-- The arguments to 'bracket' are in this order so that we can partially apply 
-- it, e.g.:
--
-- > withFile name = bracket (openFile name) hClose
--
bracket 
	:: IO a		-- ^ computation to run first (\"acquire resource\")
	-> (a -> IO b)  -- ^ computation to run last (\"release resource\")
	-> (a -> IO c)	-- ^ computation to run in-between
	-> IO c		-- returns the value from the in-between computation
bracket before after thing =
  block (do
    a <- before 
    r <- catch 
	   (unblock (thing a))
	   (\e -> do { after a; throw e })
    after a
    return r
 )
   

-- | A specialised variant of 'bracket' with just a computation to run
-- afterward.
-- 
finally :: IO a		-- ^ computation to run first
	-> IO b		-- ^ computation to run afterward (even if an exception 
			-- was raised)
	-> IO a		-- returns the value from the first computation
a `finally` sequel =
  block (do
    r <- catch 
	     (unblock a)
	     (\e -> do { sequel; throw e })
    sequel
    return r
  )

-- | A variant of 'bracket' where the return value from the first computation
-- is not required.

-- Asynchronous exceptions

{- $async

 #AsynchronousExceptions# Asynchronous exceptions are so-called because they arise due to
external influences, and can be raised at any point during execution.
'StackOverflow' and 'HeapOverflow' are two examples of
system-generated asynchronous exceptions.

The primary source of asynchronous exceptions, however, is
'throwTo':

>  throwTo :: ThreadId -> Exception -> IO ()

'throwTo' (also 'throwDynTo' and 'Control.Concurrent.killThread') allows one
running thread to raise an arbitrary exception in another thread.  The
exception is therefore asynchronous with respect to the target thread,
which could be doing anything at the time it receives the exception.
Great care should be taken with asynchronous exceptions; it is all too
easy to introduce race conditions by the over zealous use of
'throwTo'.
-}

{- $block_handler
There\'s an implied 'block' around every exception handler in a call
to one of the 'catch' family of functions.  This is because that is
what you want most of the time - it eliminates a common race condition
in starting an exception handler, because there may be no exception
handler on the stack to handle another exception if one arrives
immediately.  If asynchronous exceptions are blocked on entering the
handler, though, we have time to install a new exception handler
before being interrupted.  If this weren\'t the default, one would have
to write something like

>      block (
>           catch (unblock (...))
>                      (\e -> handler)
>      )

If you need to unblock asynchronous exceptions again in the exception
handler, just use 'unblock' as normal.

Note that 'try' and friends /do not/ have a similar default, because
there is no exception handler in this case.  If you want to use 'try'
in an asynchronous-exception-safe way, you will need to use
'block'.
-}

{- $interruptible

Some operations are /interruptible/, which means that they can receive
asynchronous exceptions even in the scope of a 'block'.  Any function
which may itself block is defined as interruptible; this includes
'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar'
(but not 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.tryTakeMVar'),
and most operations which perform
some I\/O with the outside world.  The reason for having
interruptible operations is so that we can write things like

>      block (
>         a <- takeMVar m
>         catch (unblock (...))
>               (\e -> ...)
>      )

if the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' was not interruptible,
then this particular
combination could lead to deadlock, because the thread itself would be
blocked in a state where it can\'t receive any asynchronous exceptions.
With 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' interruptible, however, we can be
safe in the knowledge that the thread can receive exceptions right up
until the point when the 'Control.Concurrent.MVar.takeMVar' succeeds.
Similar arguments apply for other interruptible operations like
'System.IO.openFile'.
