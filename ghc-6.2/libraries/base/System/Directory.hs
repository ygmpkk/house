{- $intro
A directory contains a series of entries, each of which is a named
reference to a file system object (file, directory etc.).  Some
entries may be hidden, inaccessible, or have some administrative
function (e.g. `.' or `..' under POSIX
<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm>), but in 
this standard all such entries are considered to form part of the
directory contents. Entries in sub-directories are not, however,
considered to form part of the directory contents.

Each file system object is referenced by a /path/.  There is
normally at least one absolute path to each file system object.  In
some operating systems, it may also be possible to have paths which
are relative to the current directory.

-- Permissions

{- $permissions

 The 'Permissions' type is used to record whether certain operations are
 permissible on a file\/directory. 'getPermissions' and 'setPermissions'
 get and set these permissions, respectively. Permissions apply both to
 files and directories. For directories, the executable field will be
 'False', and for files the searchable field will be 'False'. Note that
 directories may be searchable without being readable, if permission has
 been given to use them as part of a path, but not to examine the 
 directory contents.

Note that to change some, but not all permissions, a construct on the following lines must be used. 

>  makeReadable f = do
>     p <- getPermissions f
>     setPermissions f (p {readable = True})

{- |@'createDirectory' dir@ creates a new directory @dir@ which is
initially empty, or as near to empty as the operating system
allows.

The operation may fail with:

The operand refers to a directory that already exists.  
@ [EEXIST]@

* 'HardwareFault'
A physical I\/O error has occurred.
@[EIO]@

* 'InvalidArgument'
The operand is not a valid directory name.
@[ENAMETOOLONG, ELOOP]@

* 'NoSuchThing'
There is no path to the directory. 
@[ENOENT, ENOTDIR]@

* 'ResourceExhausted'
Insufficient resources (virtual memory, process file descriptors,
physical disk space, etc.) are available to perform the operation.
@[EDQUOT, ENOSPC, ENOMEM, EMLINK]@

* 'InappropriateType'
The path refers to an existing non-directory object.
@[EEXIST]@

{- | @'removeDirectory' dir@ removes an existing directory /dir/.  The
implementation may specify additional constraints which must be
satisfied before a directory can be removed (e.g. the directory has to
be empty, or may not be in use by other processes).  It is not legal
for an implementation to partially remove a directory unless the
entire directory is removed. A conformant implementation need not
support directory removal in all situations (e.g. removal of the root
directory).

directory from /old/ to /new/.  If the /new/ directory
already exists, it is atomically replaced by the /old/ directory.

alias of the /old/ directory, it is removed as if by
'removeDirectory'.  A conformant implementation need not support
renaming directories in all situations (e.g. renaming to an existing
directory, or across different physical devices), but the constraints
must be documented.

exists.
