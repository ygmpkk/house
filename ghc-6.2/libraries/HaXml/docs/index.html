<p>
<b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for using
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>
together.  Its basic facilities include:

<ul>
<li> a parser for XML,
<li> a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,
<li> an XML validator,
<li> pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
</ul>

<p>
For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
<ul>
<li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator library for generic XML document
    processing, including transformation, editing, and generation.
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read
    classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML
    documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool (available from
    <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
    <tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
    can automatically derive this class for you.
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
    into equivalent Haskell types.
<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
    this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
    typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable
    XML documents.
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em> is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents,
    loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used
    either from the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
    library.
</ul>

<p>
<a href="HaXml/index.html">Detailed documentation of the HaXml APIs</a>
is generated automatically by Haddock directly from the source code.

An introduction to HaXml for people who know more about XML than
about Haskell can be found at

<p>
A paper describing and comparing the generic Combinators with
the typed representation (DtdToHaskell/Xml2Haskell) is available here:
(12 pages of double-column A4)
<ul>
<li> <a href="icfp99.dvi">icfp99.dvi</a>     (LaTeX dvi format)
<li> <a href="icfp99.ps.gz">icfp99.ps.gz</a> (PostScript format - gzipped)
<li> <a href="icfp99.html">icfp99.html</a>   (HTML format)
</ul>

Some additional info about using the various facilities is here:

<li> <a href="Combinators.html">Combinators</a>       (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Haskell2Xml.html">Haskell2Xml class</a> (HTML format)

<li> <a href="Xtract.html">Xtract tool</a>            (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li> To use <em>-package HaXml</em> interactively with GHCi, you need
     at least ghci-5.02.3.
<li> Haskell2Xml generates Parameter Entity Declarations in the internal
     subset of the DTD, which don't conform to the strict well-formedness
     conditions of XML.  We think the constraint in question is spurious,
     and any reasonable XML tool ought to deal adequately with full PEs.
     Nevertheless, many standard XML processors reject these auto-generated
     DTDs.  The solution is easy - just move the DTD into a separate file!
<li> DtdToHaskell generates the Haskell String type for DTD attributes
     that are of Tokenized or Notation Types in XML.  This may not be
     entirely accurate.
</ul>

The development version of HaXml is available by anonymous CVS
(write-access is also available to core Haskell developers).  Read the
instructions for getting ghc by CVS:
<a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html">
http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html</a>

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install HaXml, you must have a Haskell compiler: <em>ghc-5.02</em>
or later, and/or <em>nhc98-1.14/hmake-3.06</em> or later.  HaXml-1.09
has not been tested with recent versions of Hugs (we last tested at
HaXml-1.05, and would like some advice and help on how things work
with the newest versions of Hugs).  Use

<pre>
    ./configure [--prefix=...]
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install HaXml as a package for your
compiler(s).  Afterwards, to gain access to the HaXml libraries,
you only need to add the option <tt>-package HaXml</tt> to your
compiler commandline.  Various stand-alone tools are also built -
DtdToHaskell, Xtract, Validate, MkOneOf - and copied to your final
preferred installation location, specified by the <tt>--prefix=...</tt>
option to <tt>configure</tt>.

<center><h3><a name="news">Recent news</a></h3></center>
<p>
The latest version (1.09) has the following fixes:<br>
<ul>
<li> <em>ghc-6.0</em> is supported.
<li> <em>hmake</em> is no longer required to build HaXml, provided you 
     have <em>ghc --make</em>.
<li> A new combinator <tt>path</tt> has been added to
     Text.XML.HaXml.Combinators, allowing queries to be expressed in the
     style of XPath.
<li> Some of the signatures in Text.XML.HaXml.Xml2Haskell have changed,
     in particular, there are new functions <tt>readXml</tt> and
     <tt>showXml</tt> that convert to/from Strings, <tt>hGetXml</tt> and
     <tt>hPutXml</tt> that use file Handles, and the old functions that
     use filenames are renamed to <tt>fReadXml</tt> and <tt>fWriteXml</tt>.
<li> DtdToHaskell previously generated incorrect code for reading an XML
     element given the following DTD fragment:
     <pre>&lt;!ELEMENT foo (a,b)+ &gt;</pre>
<li> The parser had a fault when reading conditional sections nested inside an
     IGNORE section in a DTD.
<li> In Text.XML.HaXml.Html.Generate, all functions now generate HTML tags
     in lower-case rather than upper-case, to conform to the XHTML standard.
<li> DtdToHaskell now accepts NOTATION types for attributes.  They are
     treated just like enumeration types.
<li> If you give an output filename as a command-line argument to DtdToHaskell,
     it now uses the filename as the basis for the generated module name.
<li> Fixed a configuration bug on the Cygwin platform with ghc-5.04.x.
<li> <em>make install</em> now places the executables (DtdToHaskell, Xtract,
     Validate, MkOneOf, Canonicalise) into the directory specified by
     <tt>./configure --prefix=...</tt>
</ul>


<p>
The previous version (1.08) had the following new features:<br>
<ul>
<li> A new and highly useful function, Text.XML.HaXml.Validate.partialValidate,
     does validation except for checking whether the root element type matches
     that of the DTD's root element.  This is just what you need in order to
     validate any partial document or sub-document.
<li> The function Text.XML.HaXml.Html.Generate.htmlprint had a little
     bug which caused it to loop infinitely if some text was longer
     than 60 characters without a space.
<li> The Xtract parser and combinators are now included in the HaXml
     library package, rather than existing solely for the Xtract
     command-line tool.
<li> The code generated by DtdToHaskell had a minor cut-and-paste error.
<li> There were also some simple import naming problems in some of the
     demonstration files in the examples/ directory.
<li> The file `script/echo.c' was missing from the distribution.
     This only affected the configuration step on systems where
     `echo -n' is not recognised (e.g. Solaris).
</ul>
