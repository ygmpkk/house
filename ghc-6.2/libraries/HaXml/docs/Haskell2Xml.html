<p>
<b>Text.XML.HaXml.Haskell2Xml</b> is a library for translating Haskell
data from any program into a valid XML document (and back again), by
generating a DTD and the appropriate functions to write and write the
XML format.  In principle, it gives an alternative to the standard Read
and Show classes, and allows you to use other standard XML-processing
tools on your Haskell datafiles.

<p>
<b>Usage.</b>
It works rather like the existing <em>Read</em> and <em>Show</em>
classes: you must create an instance of the <em>Haskell2Xml</em>
class for every datatype you wish to use for I/O.  However, because
this class is not a standard one, no Haskell compilers support
the <tt>deriving</tt> clause for it yet.  Fear not!  There is a
pre-processor tool called
<a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/"><b>DrIFT</b></a>
which derives class instances automatically.  We have extended
DrIFT's ruleset to include the <em>Haskell2Xml</em> class.
The only remaining thing is to ensure that you import the
<b>Text.XML.HaXml.Haskell2Xml</b> module everywhere you use it.

<p>
(Please note that DrIFT is sometimes a bit fragile when parsing Haskell
sources - it occasionally fails to recognise the <em>derive</em>
command.  We have found a workaround: isolate just the <tt>data</tt>
type declarations that are of interest, and run DrIFT on them
separately.)

<p>
To read and write Haskell data values as XML files, use the functions
<pre>
    Haskell2Xml.readXml  :: XmlContent a => FilePath -> IO a
    Haskell2Xml.writeXml :: XmlContent a => FilePath -> a -> IO ()
</pre>
not forgetting to resolve the overloading in one of the usual ways
(e.g. by implicit context at point of use, by explicit type signatures
on values, use value as an argument to a function with an explicit
signature, use <tt>`asTypeOf`</tt>, etc.)
