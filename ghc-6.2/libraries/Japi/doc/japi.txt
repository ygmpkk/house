Partial binding for the nifty cross-platform, multi language 
Java Swing based "Japi" GUI library at:
   http://www.japi.de/
which requires that either "jre" or "java" to be in the path.

Get the package for your platform ("libjapi.a" and "japi.h")
then place those in your compiler searchable lib and include
directories.  

The examples directory includes a make file showing how to 
build programs with the package.  The top level NHC98 makefile
performs the same function for NHC98.


NHC98

Makefile.nhc98 has not yet been fully integrated with the NHC98
build infrastructure.

To build the library without the remainder of the CVS tree
being built. eg with a standalone binary NHC98 distribution,
just use Makefile.nhc98.standalone.

Note that for Cygwin NHC98 I had to put the Java 1.4 SDK
JRE bin at the front of the path:

  export PATH=/e/lang/j2sdk1.4.0/jre/bin:${PATH}

as the "java" executable which was located in the Windows 
system directory had problems with the Cygwin/nhc98 Japi
executables (I assume pathing problems):

$ ./examples/borderpanel
can't connect to server -> starting new kernel
No JRE found ... trying JAVA ...
no Java Runtime Environment found ...
xmessage: not found
Could not start the JAPI server (jre or java)

$ which java
/c/WINNT/system32/java
