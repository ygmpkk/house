  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Previous versions of GHC (versions 5.02 and older) came with a
  set of libraries called the <literal>hslibs</literal>, also known as
  the Hugs-GHC libraries.  These libraries are being phased out in
  favour of the new hierarchical libraries, but for the time being we
  still provide <literal>hslibs</literal> for backwards
  compatibility.</para>

  <para>The status of each module in <literal>hslibs</literal> can be
  considered to have three possible values:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Moved</term>
      <listitem>
	<para>The module has moved to the hierarchical libraries, and
	its documentation (in this document) will report its new
	location.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Not moved</term>
      <listitem>
	<para>The module is waiting to be moved to the new
	hierarchical libraries, but it hasn't moved yet.  Please
	continue to use it from its current <literal>hslibs</literal>
	package for the time being.  The documentation for the module
	(if it had any) is still in place in this document.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Deprecated</term>
      <listitem>
	<para>The module is deprecated and should not be used.  A
	deprecated module will be indicated as such in its
	documentation, along with an suggested alternative API.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

    <para>If you're using hslibs with GHC[i], then you need to add
      <option>-package <replaceable>p</replaceable></option> to the
      command line for each package from which you're using a
      module. See the <ulink
      url="../users_guide/packages.html">section on packages in the
      User's Guide</ulink> for an explanation of packages.</para>
