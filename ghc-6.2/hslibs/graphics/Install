Win32 Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure is suggested for installation of the HGL on a
Windows machine.

  0) Choose a directory for the Graphics library to go in.

     In the following, we'll assume c:\Hugs and we'll assume that Hugs
     is installed in c:\Hugs\Hugs98

  1) Unzip the Graphics and Win32 libraries.

  2) Test the library

     c:\Hugs98\Hugs98\runHugs -Pc:\Hugs98\win32;c:\Hugs98\graphics-@VERSION@\lib\win32; c:\Hugs98\graphics-@VERSION@/demos/HelloWorld.hs

  3) Modify your path to include the Graphics and Win32 libraries.

     This is normally done by starting Hugs and executing this command:

       :set -Pc:\Hugs98\win32;c:\Hugs98\graphics-@VERSION@\lib\win32;


Unix Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following procedure is suggested for installation of the HGL on a
Unix machine.

Short version:
   
     tar zxf graphics-@VERSION@.src.tar.gz
     gmake -C graphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11 
     runhugs -Pgraphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11: graphics-@VERSION@/demos/HelloWorld.hs
     
Long version:

  0) Choose a directory for the library to go in.
     In the following, we'll assume $HOME/local.

     Check that these directories have appropriate permission settings.

  1) Unpack the library

       cd $HOME/local
       tar zxf $HOME/graphics-@VERSION@.src.tar.gz

  2) Build the StdDIS, X and Xlib libraries [Source distribution only]

     If you have a tolerably up to date, normal Unix box, you can
     probably just run

          gmake -C graphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11 

     If your X11 installation is not in /usr/X11R6, you can
     override the default like so:

          gmake -C graphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11 X_dir=/usr/local/X11R6

     If that fails feel free to edit the Makefile and mail us
     whatever works.

  3) Make the documentation

          gmake -C graphics-@VERSION@/doc dvi ps psgz

     If you have latex2html installed, you can make an html version too:

          gmake -C graphics-@VERSION@/doc html

     [Of course, you can just download the documentation from the webpage]

  4) Test the library

       runhugs -Pgraphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11: graphics-@VERSION@/demos/HelloWorld.hs

  5) Edit setting of HUGSFLAGS in .cshrc, .bashrc, etc to include

       -P$HOME/local/graphics-@VERSION@/lib/x11:

Enjoy,
