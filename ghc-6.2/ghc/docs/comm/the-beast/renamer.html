    <h1>The GHC Commentary - The Glorious Renamer</h1>
    <p>

(This section is, like most of the Commentary, rather incomplete.)
<p>
The <em>renamer</em> sits between the parser and the typechecker.
Roughly speaking, It has the type:
<pre>
   HsModule RdrName -> HsModule Name
</pre>
That is, it converts all the <tt>RdrNames</tt> to <a href="names.html"><tt>Names</tt></a>.

<h2> RdrNames </h2>

A <tt>RdrNames</tt> is pretty much just a string (for an unqualified name
like "<tt>f</tt>") or a pair of strings (for a qualified name like "<tt>M.f</tt>"):
<pre>
    data RdrName = RdrName Qual OccName
    
    data Qual = Unqual
    
	      | Qual ModuleName     -- A qualified name written by the user in source code
				    -- The module isn't necessarily the module where
				    -- the thing is defined; just the one from which it
				    -- is imported
    
	      | Orig ModuleName	    -- This is an *original* name; the module is the place
				    -- where the thing was defined
</pre>
The OccName type is described in <a href="names.html#occname">"The truth about names"</a>.
<p>
The <tt>OrigName</tt> variant is used internally; it allows GHC to speak of <tt>RdrNames</tt>
that refer to the original name of the thing.


<h2> Rebindable syntax </h2>

In Haskell when one writes "3" one gets "fromInteger 3", where
"fromInteger" comes from the Prelude (regardless of whether the
Prelude is in scope).  If you want to completely redefine numbers,
that becomes inconvenient.  So GHC lets you say
"-fno-implicit-prelude"; in that case, the "fromInteger" comes from
whatever is in scope.  (This is documented in the User Guide.)
<p>
This feature is implemented as follows (I always forget).
<ul>
<li> Four HsSyn constructs (NegApp, NPlusKPat, HsIntegral, HsFractional) 
contain a <tt>Name</tt> (i.e. it is not parameterised).
<li> When the parser builds these constructs, it puts in the built-in Prelude
Name (e.g. PrelNum.fromInteger).
<li> When the renamer encounters these constructs, it calls <tt>RnEnv.lookupSyntaxName</tt>.
This checks for <tt>-fno-implicit-prelude</tt>; if not, it just returns the same Name;
otherwise it takes the occurrence name of the Name, turns it into an unqualified RdrName, and looks
it up in the environment.  The returned name is plugged back into the construct.
<li> The typechecker uses the Name to generate the appropriate typing constraints.
</ul>
