    <h1>The GHC Commentary - Checking Types</h1>
    <p>
      Probably the most important phase in the frontend is the type checker,
      which is located at <a
	href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/"><code>fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/</code>.</a>
      GHC type checks programs in their original Haskell form before the
      desugarer converts them into Core code.  This complicates the type
      checker as it has to handle the much more verbose Haskell AST, but it
      improves error messages, as the those message are based on the same
      structure that the user sees.
    <p>
      GHC defines the abstract syntax of Haskell programs in <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/hsSyn/HsSyn.lhs"><code>HsSyn</code></a>
      using a structure that abstracts over the concrete representation of
      bound occurences of identifiers and patterns.  The module <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcHsSyn.lhs"><code>TcHsSyn</code></a>
      instantiates this structure for the type checker using <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcEnv.lhs"><code>TcEnv</code></a>.<code>TcId</code>
      to represent identifiers - in fact, a <code>TcId</code> is currently
      nothing but just a synonym for a <a href="vars.html">plain
      <code>Id</code>.</a>

    <h4>Types Variables and Zonking</h4>
    <p>
      During type checking type variables are represented by mutable variables
      - cf. the <a href="vars.html#TyVar">variable story.</a>  Consequently,
      unification can instantiate type variables by updating those mutable
      variables.  This process of instantiation is (for reasons that elude
      me) called <a
      href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=zonk&db=*">zonking</a>
      in GHC's sources.  The zonking routines for the various forms of Haskell
      constructs are responsible for most of the code in the module <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcHsSyn.lhs"><code>TcHsSyn</code>,</a>
      whereas the routines that actually operate on mutable types are defined
      in <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcMType.lhs"><code>TcMTypes</code></a>;
      this includes routines to create mutable structures and update them as
      well as routines that check constraints, such as that type variables in
      function signatures have not been instantiated during type checking.
      The actual type unification routine is <code>uTys</code> in the same
      module.
    <p>
      All type variables that may be instantiated (those in signatures
      may not), but haven't been instantiated during type checking, are zonked
      to <code>()</code>, so that after type checking all mutable variables
      have been eliminated.

    <h4>Type Checking Environment</h4>
    <p>
      During type checking, GHC maintains a <em>type environment</em> whose
      details are fixed in <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcEnv.lhs"><code>TcEnv.lhs</code>.</a>
      Among other things, the environment contains all imported and local
      instances as well as a list of <em>global</em> entities (imported and
      local types and classes together with imported identifiers) and
      <em>local</em> entities (locally defined identifiers).  This environment
      is threaded through the type checking monad.

    <h4>Expressions</h4>
    <p>
      Expressions are type checked by <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/TcExpr.lhs"><code>TcExpr.lhs</code>.</a>  
    <p>
      Usage occurences of identifiers are processed by the function
      <code>tcId</code> whose main purpose is to <a href="#inst">instantiate
      overloaded identifiers.</a> It essentially calls
      <code>TcInst.instOverloadedFun</code> once for each universally
      quantified set of type constraints.  It should be noted that overloaded
      identifiers are replaced by new names that are first defined in the LIE
      (Local Instance Environment?) and later promoted into top-level
      bindings.
      
    <h4><a name="inst">Handling of Dictionaries and Method Instances</a></h4>
    <p>
      GHC implements overloading using so-called <em>dictionaries.</em> A
      dictionary is a tuple of functions -- one function for each method in
      the class of which the dictionary implements an instance.  During type
      checking, GHC replaces each type constraint of a function with one
      additional argument.  At runtime, the extended function gets passed a
      matching class dictionary by way of these additional arguments.
      Whenever the function needs to call a method of such a class, it simply
      extracts it from the dictionary.
    <p>
      This sounds simple enough; however, the actual implementation is a bit
      more tricky as it wants to keep track of all the instances at which
      overloaded functions are used in a module.  This information is useful
      to optimise the code.  The implementation is the module <a
      href="http://cvs.haskell.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fptools/ghc/compiler/typecheck/Inst.lhs"><code>Inst.lhs</code>.</a>
    <p>
      The function <code>instOverloadedFun</code> is invoked for each
      overloaded usage occurence of an identifier, where overloaded means that
      the type of the idendifier contains a non-trivial type constraint.  It
      proceeds in two steps: (1) Allocation of a method instance
      (<code>newMethodWithGivenTy</code>) and (2) instantiation of functional
      dependencies.  The former implies allocating a new unique identifier,
      which replaces the original (overloaded) identifier at the currently
      type-checked usage occurrence.
    <p>
      The new identifier (after being threaded through the LIE) eventually
      will be bound by a top-level binding whose rhs contains a partial
      application of the original overloaded identifier.  This papp applies
      the overloaded function to the dictionaries needed for the current
      instance.  In GHC lingo, this is called a <em>method.</em>  Before
      becoming a top-level binding, the method is first represented as a value
      of type <code>Inst.Inst</code>, which makes it easy to fold multiple
      instances of the same identifier at the same types into one global
      definition.  (And probably other things, too, which I haven't
      investigated yet.)

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> As of 13 January 2001 (wrt. to the code in the
      CVS HEAD), the above mechanism interferes badly with RULES pragmas
      defined over overloaded functions.  During instantiation, a new name is
      created for an overloaded function partially applied to the dictionaries
      needed in a usage position of that function.  As the rewrite rule,
      however, mentions the original overloaded name, it won't fire anymore
      -- unless later phases remove the intermediate definition again.  The
      latest CVS version of GHC has an option
      <code>-fno-method-sharing</code>, which avoids sharing instantiation
      stubs.  This is usually/often/sometimes sufficient to make the rules
      fire again.
