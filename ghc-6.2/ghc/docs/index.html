      Welcome to GHC!

    <P>
      This is the top of the GHC documentation tree, where you will find
      links to all the supplied documentation about GHC and its libraries.

          The User's Guide has all you need to know about using GHC:
          command line options, language extensions, GHCi, etc.

        </P>
        <P>
          Previous versions of GHC (before version 5.04) came with a suite
          of libraries known as <TT>hslibs</TT>, aka the Hugs-GHC libraries.
          As we are in the process of moving towards using hierarchical
          libraries for everything, many of these libraries have moved over to
          the new packages in the hierarchical libraries above.  We still
          provide the old <TT>hslibs</TT> libraries for backwards compatibility
          and also for those libraries which have yet to move into the
          hierarchy.  For libraries which have moved, the documentation
          contains a pointer to the location in the new libraries.
        </P>
        <P>
          Libraries which haven't moved yet, so are still only available from
          here, include: the Win32 library, HaXml,
          and a few others.
