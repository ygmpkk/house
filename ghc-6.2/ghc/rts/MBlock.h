   The HEAP_ALLOCED() test.

   HEAP_ALLOCED is called FOR EVERY SINGLE CLOSURE during GC.
   It needs to be FAST.

   Implementation of HEAP_ALLOCED
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Since heap is allocated in chunks of megablocks (MBLOCK_SIZE), we
   can just use a table to record which megablocks in the address
   space belong to the heap.  On a 32-bit machine, with 1Mb
   megablocks, using 8 bits for each entry in the table, the table
   requires 4k.  Lookups during GC will be fast, because the table
   will be quickly cached (indeed, performance measurements showed no
   measurable difference between doing the table lookup and using a
   constant comparison).
