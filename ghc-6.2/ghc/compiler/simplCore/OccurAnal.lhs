The occurrence analyser re-typechecks a core expression, returning a new
core expression with (hopefully) improved usage information.

\begin{code}
module OccurAnal (
	occurAnalyseBinds, occurAnalyseGlobalExpr, occurAnalyseRule
    ) where

#include "HsVersions.h"

Here's the externally-callable interface:

\begin{code}
occurAnalyseGlobalExpr :: CoreExpr -> CoreExpr
occurAnalyseGlobalExpr expr
  = 	-- Top level expr, so no interesting free vars, and
	-- discard occurence info returned
    snd (occAnal (initOccEnv emptyVarSet) expr)

occurAnalyseRule :: CoreRule -> CoreRule
occurAnalyseRule rule@(BuiltinRule _ _) = rule
occurAnalyseRule (Rule str act tpl_vars tpl_args rhs)
		-- Add occ info to tpl_vars, rhs
  = Rule str act tpl_vars' tpl_args rhs'
  where
    (rhs_uds, rhs') = occAnal (initOccEnv (mkVarSet tpl_vars)) rhs
    (_, tpl_vars')  = tagBinders rhs_uds tpl_vars
\end{code}

%************************************************************************

In @occAnalTop@ we do indirection-shorting.  That is, if we have this:

	x_local = <expression>
	...
	x_exported = loc

where exp is exported, and loc is not, then we replace it with this:

	x_local = x_exported
	x_exported = <expression>
	...

Without this we never get rid of the x_exported = x_local thing.  This
save a gratuitous jump (from \tr{x_exported} to \tr{x_local}), and
makes strictness information propagate better.  This used to happen in
the final phase, but it's tidier to do it here.

If more than one exported thing is equal to a local thing (i.e., the
local thing really is shared), then we do one only:
\begin{verbatim}
	x_local = ....
	x_exported1 = x_local
	x_exported2 = x_local
==>
	x_exported1 = ....

	x_exported2 = x_exported1
\end{verbatim}

We rely on prior eta reduction to simplify things like
\begin{verbatim}
	x_exported = /\ tyvars -> x_local tyvars
==>
	x_exported = x_local
\end{verbatim}
Hence,there's a possibility of leaving unchanged something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
	x_local = ....
	x_exported1 = x_local Int
\end{verbatim}
By the time we've thrown away the types in STG land this 
could be eliminated.  But I don't think it's very common
and it's dangerous to do this fiddling in STG land 
because we might elminate a binding that's mentioned in the
unfolding for something.

\begin{code}

				--   bindings of the form exported-id = local-id in

Bindings
~~~~~~~~

\begin{code}
type IdWithOccInfo = Id			-- An Id with fresh PragmaInfo attached

type Node details = (details, Unique, [Unique])	-- The Ints are gotten from the Unique,
						-- which is gotten from the Id.
type Details1	  = (Id, UsageDetails, CoreExpr)
type Details2	  = (IdWithOccInfo, CoreExpr)


occAnalBind :: OccEnv
	    -> CoreBind
	    -> UsageDetails		-- Usage details of scope
	    -> (UsageDetails,		-- Of the whole let(rec)
		[CoreBind])

occAnalBind env (NonRec binder rhs) body_usage
  | not (binder `usedIn` body_usage)		-- It's not mentioned
  = (body_usage, [])

  | otherwise			-- It's mentioned in the body
  = (final_body_usage `combineUsageDetails` rhs_usage,
     [NonRec tagged_binder rhs'])

  where
    (final_body_usage, tagged_binder) = tagBinder body_usage binder
    (rhs_usage, rhs')		      = occAnalRhs env tagged_binder rhs
\end{code}

Dropping dead code for recursive bindings is done in a very simple way:

	the entire set of bindings is dropped if none of its binders are
	mentioned in its body; otherwise none are.

This seems to miss an obvious improvement.
@
	letrec  f = ...g...
		g = ...f...
	in
	...g...

===>

	letrec f = ...g...
	       g = ...(...g...)...
	in
	...g...
@

Now @f@ is unused. But dependency analysis will sort this out into a
@letrec@ for @g@ and a @let@ for @f@, and then @f@ will get dropped.
It isn't easy to do a perfect job in one blow.  Consider

@
	letrec f = ...g...
	       g = ...h...
	       h = ...k...
	       k = ...m...
	       m = ...m...
	in
	...m...
@

	mk_new_bind tagged_bndr ((_, _, rhs'), key, keys) = ((tagged_bndr, rhs'), key, keys)
\end{code}

@reOrderRec@ is applied to the list of (binder,rhs) pairs for a cyclic
strongly connected component (there's guaranteed to be a cycle).  It returns the
same pairs, but 
	a) in a better order,
	b) with some of the Ids having a IMustNotBeINLINEd pragma

The "no-inline" Ids are sufficient to break all cycles in the SCC.  This means
that the simplifier can guarantee not to loop provided it never records an inlining
for these no-inline guys.

Furthermore, the order of the binds is such that if we neglect dependencies
on the no-inline Ids then the binds are topologically sorted.  This means
that the simplifier will generally do a good job if it works from top bottom,
recording inlinings for any Ids which aren't marked as "no-inline" as it goes.

==============
[June 98: I don't understand the following paragraphs, and I've 
	  changed the a=b case again so that it isn't a special case any more.]

Here's a case that bit me:

	letrec
		a = b
		b = \x. BIG
	in
	...a...a...a....

Re-ordering doesn't change the order of bindings, but there was no loop-breaker.

My solution was to make a=b bindings record b as Many, rather like INLINE bindings.
Perhaps something cleverer would suffice.
===============

You might think that you can prevent non-termination simply by making
sure that we simplify a recursive binding's RHS in an environment that
simply clones the recursive Id.  But no.  Consider

		letrec f = \x -> let z = f x' in ...

		in
		let n = f y
		in
		case n of { ... }

We bind n to its *simplified* RHS, we then *re-simplify* it when
we inline n.  Then we may well inline f; and then the same thing
happens with z!

I don't think it's possible to prevent non-termination by environment
manipulation in this way.  Apart from anything else, successive
iterations of the simplifier may unroll recursive loops in cases like
that above.  The idea of beaking every recursive loop with an
IMustNotBeINLINEd pragma is much much better.


\begin{code}
reOrderRec
	:: OccEnv
	-> SCC (Node Details2)

			-- Sorted into a plausible order.  Enough of the Ids have
			--	dontINLINE pragmas that there are no loops left.

	-- Non-recursive case
reOrderRec env (AcyclicSCC (bind, _, _)) = [bind]

	-- Common case of simple self-recursion
reOrderRec env (CyclicSCC [bind])
  = [(setIdOccInfo tagged_bndr IAmALoopBreaker, rhs)]

    ((tagged_bndr, rhs), _, _) = bind

reOrderRec env (CyclicSCC (bind : binds))

	-- do SCC analysis on the rest, and recursively sort them out
    concat (map (reOrderRec env) (stronglyConnCompR unchosen))

  where
    (chosen_pair, unchosen) = choose_loop_breaker bind (score bind) [] binds
    (tagged_bndr, rhs)      = chosen_pair

	-- This loop looks for the bind with the lowest score

		-- it's *really* helpful if dictionaries get inlined fast,
		-- so I'm experimenting with giving higher priority to data-typed things

	| inlineCandidate bndr rhs = 2	-- Likely to be inlined

	| not (isEmptyCoreRules (idSpecialisation bndr)) = 1
		-- Avoid things with specialisations; we'd like
		-- to take advantage of them in the subsequent bindings

	| otherwise = 0

    inlineCandidate :: Id -> CoreExpr -> Bool
    inlineCandidate id (Note InlineMe _) = True
    inlineCandidate id rhs	         = isOneOcc (idOccInfo id)

	-- Real example (the Enum Ordering instance from PrelBase):
	--	rec	f = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> p x
	--		g = \ x -> case d of (p,q,r) -> q x
	--		d = (v, f, g)
	--
	-- Here, f and g occur just once; but we can't inline them into d.
	-- On the other hand we *could* simplify those case expressions if
	-- we didn't stupidly choose d as the loop breaker.
	-- But we won't because constructor args are marked "Many".

    not_fun_ty ty = not (isFunTy (dropForAlls ty))
\end{code}

@occAnalRhs@ deals with the question of bindings where the Id is marked
by an INLINE pragma.  For these we record that anything which occurs
in its RHS occurs many times.  This pessimistically assumes that ths
inlined binder also occurs many times in its scope, but if it doesn't
we'll catch it next time round.  At worst this costs an extra simplifier pass.
ToDo: try using the occurrence info for the inline'd binder.

[March 97] We do the same for atomic RHSs.  Reason: see notes with reOrderRec.
[June 98, SLPJ]  I've undone this change; I don't understand it.  See notes with reOrderRec.


\begin{code}
occAnalRhs :: OccEnv

	--	g  = f x3
	-- First time round, it looks as if x1 and x2 occur as an arg of a 
	-- let-bound constructor ==> give them a many-occurrence.
	-- But then x3 is inlined (unconditionally as it happens) and
	-- next time round, x2 will be, and the next time round x1 will be
	-- Result: multiple simplifier iterations.  Sigh.  
	-- Crude solution: use rhsCtxt for things that occur just once...

    certainly_inline id = case idOccInfo id of
			    OneOcc in_lam one_br -> not in_lam && one_br
			    other		 -> False

	-- [March 98] A new wrinkle is that if the binder has specialisations inside
	-- it then we count the specialised Ids as "extra rhs's".  That way
	-- the "parent" keeps the specialised "children" alive.  If the parent

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~
\begin{code}
occAnal :: OccEnv
	-> CoreExpr
	-> (UsageDetails,	-- Gives info only about the "interesting" Ids
	    CoreExpr)

occAnal env (Type t)  = (emptyDetails, Type t)

occAnal env (Var v) 
  = (var_uds, Var v)
  where
    var_uds | isCandidate env v = unitVarEnv v oneOcc
	    | otherwise	        = emptyDetails

    -- At one stage, I gathered the idRuleVars for v here too,
    -- which in a way is the right thing to do.
    -- But that went wrong right after specialisation, when
    -- the *occurrences* of the overloaded function didn't have any
    -- rules in them, so the *specialised* versions looked as if they
    -- weren't used at all.

\end{code}

We regard variables that occur as constructor arguments as "dangerousToDup":

\begin{verbatim}
module A where
f x = let y = expensive x in 
      let z = (True,y) in 
      (case z of {(p,q)->q}, case z of {(p,q)->q})
\end{verbatim}

We feel free to duplicate the WHNF (True,y), but that means
that y may be duplicated thereby.

If we aren't careful we duplicate the (expensive x) call!
Constructors are rather like lambdas in this way.

\begin{code}
occAnal env expr@(Lit lit) = (emptyDetails, expr)

    (body_usage, Lam x body')
    }

-- For value lambdas we do a special hack.  Consider
-- 	(\x. \y. ...x...)
-- If we did nothing, x is used inside the \y, so would be marked
-- as dangerous to dup.  But in the common case where the abstraction
-- is applied to two arguments this is over-pessimistic.

Case alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the case binder occurs at all, the other binders effectively do too.  
For example
	case e of x { (a,b) -> rhs }
is rather like
	let x = (a,b) in rhs
If e turns out to be (e1,e2) we indeed get something like
	let a = e1; b = e2; x = (a,b) in rhs

\begin{code}
occAnalAlt env case_bndr (con, bndrs, rhs)
  = case occAnal (env `addNewCands` bndrs) rhs of { (rhs_usage, rhs') ->
    let
        (final_usage, tagged_bndrs) = tagBinders rhs_usage bndrs
	final_bndrs | case_bndr `elemVarEnv` final_usage = bndrs
		    | otherwise				= tagged_bndrs
		-- Leave the binders untagged if the case 
		-- binder occurs at all; see note above
    in
    (final_usage, (con, final_bndrs, rhs')) }
