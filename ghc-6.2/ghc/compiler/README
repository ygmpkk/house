This directory contains the source for Glorious Glasgow Haskell
compiler proper, normally a binary called "hsc".  The source is
organized into _one_ level of directories, and the literate Haskell
source files sit in those directories (i.e., */*.lhs).

The only "real" subdirectory is the tests/ directory [NB: not
distributed normally, but available to gluttons for punishment], which
includes some tests that we use to make sure we're not going
backwards.  The subdirs of the test directory "match" the subdirs of
the main source directory; e.g., the desugarer is in subdir deSugar/,
and the tests for the desugarer are in tests/deSugar/.
