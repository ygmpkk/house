The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
============================

(this file is fptools/ghc/README in a source distribution, and
fptools/README in a binary distribution).

GHC is a batch compiler for Haskell 98.  See the file ANNOUNCE for
information on the current version.

Haskell is "the" standard lazy functional programming language.
Haskell 98 is the current version of the language, released in
December 1998.  The language definition is on the Web at
http://www.haskell.org/definition/.

In a binary distribution, pre-formatted documentation can be found in
the html and ps directories.  Pre-formatted HTML documentation is also

the following places:

  * fptools/ghc/docs/users_guide  Users' Guide.
