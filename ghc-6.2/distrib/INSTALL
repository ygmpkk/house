This is the INSTALL instructions for a binary distribution of one of
the fptools projects (eg. GHC). For more details on what on earth this
package is up to, please consult the README and ANNOUNCE.

To start using the bundle, you can either:

* use it in-place, i.e., don't go ahead with a
  full install, but just set it up to use the unpacked
  distribution in-situ.

* get it over with, and do the full install (details of how are ahead).

To set the ball rolling, run the configure script (as usual, run the
script with --help to see what options it supports).  eg. to set up
the package for installing in directory <my-dir>, use

	./configure --prefix=<my-dir>

The default installation directory is /usr/local.  For using the
package in-place, the --prefix option can be omitted.

This will figure out what platform you're running on, and a couple of
other interesting pieces of trivia, which it will then fill in the
Makefile.in template to give you a real Makefile.  If you're of a
paranoid persuasion, you might want to take a look at this Makefile to
see if the information is correct.

To use the software in-place, now run:

	make in-place

or if you're installing,  run

	make install 

(`make show-install-setup' prints the details of where the different
pieces of the bundle are heading when -- possibly helpful).

If you're installing GHC, then its installation instructions have more
information, check out http://www.haskell.org/ghc/documentation.html.

Bug reports/suggestions for improvement to the installation procedure/setup
(as well as other GHC related troubles you're experiencing, of course),
gratefully received at glasgow-haskell-bugs@haskell.org.

Enjoy,
