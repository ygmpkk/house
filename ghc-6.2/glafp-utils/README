This directory tree's worth of stuff are utility bits that are used in
more than one of the Glasgow functional-programming tools.  (For the
project-specific bits, try <project>/utils/<blah>.)

 lndir		from X imake stuff (via DuBois); make a shadow tree
		of symbolic links

 ltx		a "latex" wrapper.  Re-runs latex/bibtex/makeindex
		enough times to "do the right thing."

 mkdependC	script version of C makedepend (from X11R4 via DuBois)

 mkdirhier	"mkdir a/b/c/d" will do "mkdir a; mkdir a/b; ..."
		(assuming none of those dirs exist)

 runstdtest	runs a pgm with some flags & some stdin; checks for an
		expected exit code, expected stdout, and expected
		stderr.  (Expect this to change :-)

 verbatim	pre-processor for LaTeX files that typesets text between
		@...@ in typewriter font.

 sgmlverb	pre-processor for SGML that does essentially the same thing
		as verbatim.

 docbook	scripts to process DocBook files stolen from Cygnus DocBook
 		tools.

 genargs	converts whitespace separated strings into partial
		Haskell lists.
